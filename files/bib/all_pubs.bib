	abstract = {Organizations are increasingly facing sophisticated social engineering attacks that exploit human vulnerabilities and overcome commonly available countermeasures. Spear-phishing campaigns are becoming the most prevalent attack and source of compromise for most organizations. We argue that existing prevention and detection countermeasures are fundamentally ineffective against this class of attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address the limitations of existing countermeasures. Our proposition is a new course of action to exploit human detection capabilities as a basis of automated response strategies. Preliminary results unveil users' mental models for phishing detection and reporting as a way to improve the phishing reporting process altogether. A real word case study is provided to promote the feasibility of our proposal.},

	abstract = {Phishing attacks arrive in high numbers and often spread quickly, meaning that after-the-fact countermeasures such as domain blacklisting are limited in efficacy. Visual similarity-based approaches have the potential of detecting previously unseen phishing webpages. These approaches, however, require identifying the legitimate webpage(s) they reproduce. Existing approaches rely on textual feature analysis for target identification, with misclassification rates of approximately 1\%; however, as most websites a user might visit are legitimate, additional research is needed to further reduce classification errors. In this work, we propose a novel method for target identification that relies on both visual features (extracted from a screenshot of the web page) and textual features (extracted from the DOM of the web page) to identify which website a phishing web page is replicating, and assess its effectiveness in detecting phishing websites using data from phishing aggregators such as OpenPhish, PhishTank and PhishStats. Compared to state-of-the-art text-based classifiers, our method reduces the phishing misclassification rate by 67\% (from 1.02\% to 0.34\%), for an accuracy of 99.66\%. This work provides a further step forwards toward semi-automated decision support systems for phishing detection.},

The framework is based on extant theories in the cognitive sciences, and is meant as an instrument for researchers and practitioners alike to structure and analyze SE attacks of varying sophistication, isolating specific features and their effects at the cognitive level, and providing a common structure for comparisons across different attacks. We showcase the framework against attacks reproduced in the academic literature as well as against real (highly-targeted) SE attacks reported in the wild, isolating and relating effects and techniques adopted by the attackers to the target’s cognitive process. We discuss implications for research and practice of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Phishing emails are becoming more and more sophisticated, making current detection techniques ineffective. The reporting of phishing emails from users is, thus, crucial for organizations to detect phishing attacks and mitigate their effect. Despite extensive research on how the believability of a phishing email affects detection rates, there is little to no research about the relationship between the believability of a phishing email and the associated reporting rate. In this work, we present a controlled experiment with 446 subjects to evaluate how the reporting rate of a phishing email is linked to its believability and detection rate. Our results show that the reporting rate decreases as the believability of the email increases and that around half of the subjects who detect the mail as phishing, have an intention to report the email. However, the group intending to report an email is not a subset of the group detecting the mail as phishing, suggesting that reporting is still a concept misunderstood by many.},

	abstract = {New, sophisticated phishing campaigns victimize targets in few hours from attack delivery. Some methods, such as visual similarity-based techniques, can spot these zero-hour attacks, at the cost of additional user intervention. However, more research is needed to investigate the trade-off between automatic detection and user intervention. To enable this line of research, we present a phishing detection tool that can be used to instrument scientific research in this direction. The tool can be used for experimentation on assisting user decision-making, evaluating user trust in detection, and keeping track of users' previous “bad” decisions.},

	abstract = {Phishing attacks are a main threat to organizations and individuals. Current widespread defenses based on spam filters and domain blacklisting are unfortunately insufficient. Prior work identifies phishing reporting as a key, largely untapped resource to mitigate phishing threats. Yet, its practice suffers from very low reporting rates and generally too low an uptake from users. Whereas it is known that phishing reporting behavior is affected by a number of ‘human factors’, a comprehensive view of the different theories and their effects on (intent to) report is not yet developed. To address this gap, we evaluate theories and factors analyzed in the extant literature, build a cohesive theoretical view of their effects and constructs, and develop, model, and empirically evaluate (by means of an online questionnaire, n=284) the resulting hypothesis structure. We discuss both theoretical implications of our findings and research directions for practice at a research and organizational level.},
