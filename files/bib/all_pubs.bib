	abstract = {Organizations are experiencing more and more sophisticated attacks specifically targeting their employees and customers. These attacks exploit tailored information on the victim or organization to increase their credibility. To date, no study has evaluated the role of 'traditional' phishing cognitive effects in these advanced settings. In this paper, we run a field experiment targeting 747 subjects employed in two organizations (a university and a large international consultancy company) to evaluate the interaction between phishing persuasion techniques and the success rate in a highly-tailored setting. For this purpose, we exploit well-established user notification methods to devise enhanced attack delivery techniques, and evaluate how such techniques affect success rate of our phishing campaigns. We find that the effect of 'traditional' attack techniques is widely mitigated in highly-tailored phishing settings, suggesting that current user training and detection techniques may be off-target for more sophisticated attacks. However, we find that the means by which the attack is delivered to the victim matter, and can greatly (up to three times) boost the effect of the base attack.},

Spear-phishing campaigns are becoming the most prevalent attack and source of compromise for most organizations. We argue that existing prevention and detection countermeasures are fundamentally ineffective against this class of attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address the limitations of existing countermeasures. Our proposition is a new course of action to exploit human detection capabilities as a basis of automated response strategies. Preliminary results unveil users' mental models for phishing detection and reporting as a way to improve the phishing reporting process altogether.

	abstract = {Phishing attacks arrive in high numbers and often spread quickly, meaning that after-the-fact countermeasures such as domain blacklisting are limited in efficacy. Visual similarity-based approaches have the potential of detecting previously unseen phishing webpages. These approaches, however, require identifying the legitimate webpage(s) they reproduce. Existing approaches rely on textual feature analysis for target identification, with misclassification rates of approximately 1\%; however, as most websites a user might visit are legitimate, additional research is needed to further reduce classification errors. In this work, we propose a novel method for target identification that relies on both visual features (extracted from a screenshot of the web page) and textual features (extracted from the DOM of the web page) to identify which website a phishing web page is replicating, and assess its effectiveness in detecting phishing websites using data from phishing aggregators such as OpenPhish, PhishTank and PhishStats. Compared to state-of-the-art text-based classifiers, our method reduces the phishing misclassification rate by 67\% (from 1.02\% to 0.34\%), for an accuracy of 99.66\%. This work provides a further step forwards toward semi-automated decision support systems for phishing detection.},

	abstract = {The Darkweb hosts a number of legal and illegal services that are hard to reach due to the lack, by design, of a regular 'name service' as those operated by DNSs on the clearnet. This difficulty, together with the continuous appearance of decoy mirror services and replicated domains, severely limits the investigation capabilities of researchers and law enforcement agencies interested in measuring the Darkweb phenomenon as a whole. To address this issue we developed MASSDEAL, a tool for the automated exploration of the Darkweb that automatically learns about new or previous unseen services and measures repeatedly across time and space (i.e. across multiple deployments of the same service). Relying on data collected over more than 20 thousand darkweb services sampled from September 2018 to January 2019, we perform and report an extensive analysis of service redundancy and measure the appearance of .onion mirrors as well as providing an estimation of the infrastructural redundancy behind those systems.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of underground criminal activities is often automated to maximize the data collection and to train ML models to automatically adapt data collection tools to different communities. On the other hand, sophisticated adversaries may adopt crawling-detection capabilities that may significantly jeopardize researchers' opportunities to perform the data collection, for example by putting their accounts under the spotlight and being expelled from the community. This is particularly undesirable in prominent and high-profile criminal communities where entry costs are significant (either monetarily or for example for background checking or other trust-building mechanisms). This paper presents CARONTE, a tool to semi-automatically learn virtually any forum structure for parsing and data-extraction, while maintaining a low profile for the data collection and avoiding the requirement of collecting massive datasets to maintain tool scalability. We showcase the tool against four underground forums, and compare the network traffic it generates (as seen from the adversary's position, i.e. the underground community's server) against state-of-the-art tools for web-crawling as well as human users.},

	abstract = {Phishing emails are becoming more and more sophisticated, making current detection techniques ineffective. The reporting of phishing emails from users is, thus, crucial for organizations to detect phishing attacks and mitigate their effect. Despite extensive research on how the believability of a phishing email affects detection rates, there is little to no research about the relationship between the believability of a phishing email and the associated reporting rate. In this work, we present a controlled experiment with 446 subjects to evaluate how the reporting rate of a phishing email is linked to its believability and detection rate. Our results show that the reporting rate decreases as the believability of the email increases and that around half of the subjects who detect the mail as phishing, have an intention to report the email. However, the group intending to report an email is not a subset of the group detecting the mail as phishing, suggesting that reporting is still a concept misunderstood by many.},

To enable this line of research, we present a phishing detection tool that can be used to instrument scientific research in this direction. The tool can be used for experimentation on assisting user decision-making, evaluating user trust in detection, and keeping track of users' previous “bad” decisions.},

Prior work identifies phishing reporting as a key, largely untapped resource to mitigate phishing threats. Yet, its practice suffers from very low reporting rates and generally too low an uptake from users. Whereas it is known that phishing reporting behavior is affected by a number of ‘human factors’, a comprehensive view of the different theories and their effects on (intent to) report is not yet developed. To address this gap, we evaluate theories and factors analyzed in the extant literature, build a cohesive theoretical view of their effects and constructs, and develop, model, and empirically evaluate (by means of an online questionnaire, n=284) the resulting hypothesis structure. We discuss both theoretical implications of our findings and research directions for practice at a research and organizational level.},
