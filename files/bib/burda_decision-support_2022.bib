	abstract = {New, sophisticated phishing campaigns victimize targets in few hours from attack delivery. Some methods, such as visual similarity-based techniques, can spot these zero-hour attacks, at the cost of additional user intervention. However, more research is needed to investigate the trade-off between automatic detection and user intervention. To enable this line of research, we present a phishing detection tool that can be used to instrument scientific research in this direction. The tool can be used for experimentation on assisting user decision-making, evaluating user trust in detection, and keeping track of users' previous “bad” decisions.},
