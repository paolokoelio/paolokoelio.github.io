I have completed my [PhD-TA](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_let_2024) in Jan 2024 at the <a href="https://security1.win.tue.nl" target="_blank">Security Cluster</a>
<!-- [Security Cluster](https://security1.win.tue.nl)  -->
of Eindhoven University of Technology under the supervision of [dr. Allodi](https://lallodi.github.io/) and [dr. Zannone](https://zannone.win.tue.nl/). 

Link to my thesis: [https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_let_2024](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_let_2024)


My research explored the interactions between [social engineering attacks and human cognition](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_cognition_2023). Phishing attacks exploiting target-related information can be particularly [effective](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_testing_2020) and [difficult to counteract](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_dont_2020), therefore my focus lies on [characterizing](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_dissecting_2021) such threats and defending against them with [technological](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_decision-support_2022) and organizatinoal [[1](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/marin_influence_2023),[2](https://paolokoelio.github.io//publication/burda_phishing_2025)] methods.

To enable my research, together with my group, we established a Research as a Service collaboration with the [Information Services](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/about-the-university/support-services/library-and-information-services/ict-security) department at TU/e in terms of:
  * University as a lab: periodic, structured experimentation within TU/e
  * Synchronization of needs and opportunities: feedback loop between my research group and the IS department
  
The IT department receives:
  * evaluations of organizational resilience (e.g., spear-phishing vulnerability and response effectiveness assessment)
  * reports and recommendations (e.g., policy effectiveness, security mitigation strategies, testing new ideas)

We receive:
  * access to data and infrastructure for research (e.g., phishing attacks, network traffic)
  * support and collaboration for deployments (e.g., experiments, involvement in anti-phishing activities)
