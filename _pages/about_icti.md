I am an IT consultant and researcher at [ICTI](https://ictinstitute.nl/team/pavlo-burda/), where we provide information security advice and IT reviews to organizations, helping them achieve ISO 27001 certification. My work includes research and educational projects; recent efforts involve a journal publication on phishing reporting in organizations [[1](https://paolokoelio.github.io//publication/burda_phishing_2025)], a conference paper on fairnes in algorithmic decision-making [[2](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_fairness_2026)].
 
I am also a part-time lecturer in the [Skills for AI](https://studiegids.vu.nl/en/vakken/2025-2026/XM_0077#/) course and CS '[Business Track](https://ictinstitute.nl/research-results-thesis/)' BSc project at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. From time to time, I enjoy talking about interesting topics in security and lightweight data science at summerschools and webinars.
