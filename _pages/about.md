I'm a PhD student and Teaching Assistant at the Security Group of Eindhoven University of Technology.

My research is aimed at exploring the interactions between social engineering attacks and human cognition. Targeted attacks can be extremely effective and are particularly difficult to counteract, therefore my focus lies on characterizing such threats and defending against them.
