I'm a PhD student and Teaching Assistant at the [Security Group](https://security1.win.tue.nl) of Eindhoven University of Technology.

My research is aimed at exploring the interactions between [social engineering attacks and human cognition](). Attacks exploiting target-related information can be particularly [effective]() and [difficult to counteract](), therefore my focus lies on [characterizing]() such threats and [defending]() against them.
