<!-- I have completed the [PhD-TA](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_let_2024) program at the [Security Group](https://security1.win.tue.nl) of Eindhoven University of Technology. -->

I have recently comleted my [PhD-TA](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_let_2024) program at the <a href="https://security1.win.tue.nl" target="_blank">Security Cluster</a>
<!-- [Security Cluster](https://security1.win.tue.nl)  -->
of Eindhoven University of Technology under the supervision of [dr. Allodi](https://lallodi.github.io/) and [dr. Zannone](https://zannone.win.tue.nl/). 

My research explored the interactions between [social engineering attacks and human cognition](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_cognition_2023). Phishing attacks exploiting target-related information can be particularly [effective](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_testing_2020) and [difficult to counteract](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_dont_2020), therefore my focus lies on [characterizing](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_dissecting_2021) such threats and defending against them with [technological](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_decision-support_2022) and [organizational](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/marin_influence_2023) methods.

Completing a PhD is essentially an exercise of long-term project management where designing short-term goals, making timelines and managing stakeholders are necessary to meet deadlines.
In this project, I gained experience in asking the right questions and systematically approaching complex problems, such as finding relevant data, designing ways to analyze and understand it and synthesizing relevant outcomes. 
Getting along and efficient communication with others, receiving-giving feedback, and mentoring students enabled effective team- and inter-department collaborations. 
Finally, I developed written communication and public speaking skills to share my research with general and experienced audience.
