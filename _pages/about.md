<!-- I have completed the [PhD-TA](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_let_2024) program at the [Security Group](https://security1.win.tue.nl) of Eindhoven University of Technology. -->

I am an IT consultant and researcher at [ICTI](https://ictinstitute.nl/team/pavlo-burda/), where we provide information security advice and IT reviews to organizations, helping them achieve ISO 27001 certification. Our work includes research and educational projects; recent efforts involve a journal publication on phishing reporting in organizations [[2](https://paolokoelio.github.io//publication/burda_phishing_2025)], an article on AI fairness requirements [[3](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_fairness_2026)] and [in-house articles](https://ictinstitute.nl/computers-society-research-journal/). I also lecture in the [Skills for AI](https://studiegids.vu.nl/en/vakken/2025-2026/XM_0077#/) course and supervise CS '[Business Track](https://ictinstitute.nl/research-results-thesis/)' bachelor projects at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, as well as teach in the Introduction to AI summer school at Hogeschool Utrecht.


Previously, I completed my [PhD-TA](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_let_2024) at the <a href="https://security1.win.tue.nl" target="_blank">Security Cluster</a>
<!-- [Security Cluster](https://security1.win.tue.nl)  -->
of Eindhoven University of Technology under the supervision of [dr. Allodi](https://lallodi.github.io/) and [dr. Zannone](https://zannone.win.tue.nl/). 

My research explored the interactions between [social engineering attacks and human cognition](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_cognition_2023). Phishing attacks exploiting target-related information can be particularly [effective](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_testing_2020) and [difficult to counteract](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_dont_2020), therefore my focus lies on [characterizing](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_dissecting_2021) such threats and defending against them with [technological](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_decision-support_2022) and organizatinoal [[1](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/marin_influence_2023),[2](https://paolokoelio.github.io//publication/burda_phishing_2025)] methods.

To enable my research, together with my group, we established a Research as a Service collaboration with the [Information Services](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/about-the-university/support-services/library-and-information-services/ict-security) department at TU/e in terms of:
  * University as a lab: periodic, structured experimentation within TU/e
  * Synchronization of needs and opportunities: feedback loop between my research group and the IS department
  
The IS department receives:
  * evaluations of organizational resilience (e.g., spear-phishing vulnerability and response effectiveness assessment)
  * reports and recommendations (e.g., policy effectiveness, security mitigation strategies, testing new ideas)

We receive:
  * access to data and infrastructure for research (e.g., phishing attacks, network traffic)
  * support and collaboration for deployments (e.g., experiments, involvement in anti-phishing activities)

<!-- Completing a PhD is essentially an exercise of long-term project management where designing short-term goals, making timelines, and managing stakeholders are necessary to meet deadlines.
In this project, I gained experience in asking the right questions and systematically approaching complex problems, such as finding relevant data, designing ways to analyze and understand it, and synthesizing relevant outcomes. 
Getting along and efficiently communicating with others, giving feedback, and mentoring students enabled effective team- and inter-department collaborations. 
Finally, I developed written communication and public speaking skills to share my research with a general and experienced audience.  -->

<!-- To complete the PhD program I had to exercise and develop a set of skills that include:
  - systematic approach to complex problems
  - short and mid-term project managing
  - collaboration and mentoring
  - effective communication, both written and public speaking -->

<!-- Throughout my research I have applied quantitative and qualitative approaches to data collection and analysis, such as scraping, ... 
Moreover, empirical methods to carry out test ... -->
