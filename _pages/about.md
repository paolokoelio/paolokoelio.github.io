<!-- GRC, education and research in info-sec & AI -->
I am an IT consultant and (sometimes) researcher at [ICTI](https://ictinstitute.nl/team/pavlo-burda/), where we provide information security advice and IT reviews to organizations, helping them achieve the ISO 27001 certification. My work includes educational and research projects, such as [teaching at VU](https://paolokoelio.github.io/teaching/) and sporadic [publications](https://paolokoelio.github.io/teaching/). Read more [here](https://paolokoelio.github.io//about_icti/).

I have completed my [PhD](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_let_2024) at the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/computer-science/security" target="_blank">SEC Group</a>
<!-- [Security Cluster](https://security1.win.tue.nl)  -->
of Eindhoven University of Technology where I investigated the interaction between social engineering attacks and human cognition. Selected publications relate to understanding how to study SE attacks [[1](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_cognition_2023)] and how to defend angainst them [[2](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_dont_2020), [3](https://paolokoelio.github.io//publication/burda_phishing_2025), [4](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_decision-support_2022)]. Read more [here](https://paolokoelio.github.io//about_tue.).

Before joing TU/e, I was a security analyst at large Italian SOC and loosely involved in personal security projects. I am generally interested in information security and the consequences of [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/tag/enshittification/) of the Internet.
