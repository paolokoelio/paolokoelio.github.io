<!-- I have completed the [PhD-TA](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_let_2024) program at the [Security Group](https://security1.win.tue.nl) of Eindhoven University of Technology. -->

I have recently comleted my [PhD-TA](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_let_2024) program at the <a href="https://security1.win.tue.nl" target="_blank">Security Cluster</a>
<!-- [Security Cluster](https://security1.win.tue.nl)  -->
of Eindhoven University of Technology under the supervision of [dr. Allodi](https://lallodi.github.io/) and [dr. Zannone](https://zannone.win.tue.nl/). 

My research explored the interactions between [social engineering attacks and human cognition](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_cognition_2023). Phishing attacks exploiting target-related information can be particularly [effective](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_testing_2020) and [difficult to counteract](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_dont_2020), therefore my focus lies on [characterizing](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_dissecting_2021) such threats and defending against them with [technological](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/burda_decision-support_2022) and [organizational](https://paolokoelio.github.io/publication/marin_influence_2023) methods.
